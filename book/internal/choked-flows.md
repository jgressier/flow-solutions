# Choked flows

The main application where choked flow situation arises is the nozzle where the flow has be be accelerated from subsonic to supersonic velocities to produce thrust.
However, many other situations exist and may produce undesirable behaviors such as hysteresis. The following notebooks will detail some of them.

- two-throats internal flow
- supersonic air intake
- thermal choking
